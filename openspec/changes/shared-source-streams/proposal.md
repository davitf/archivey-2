# Shared-source stream primitive + concurrent-open contract (Phase 6 gate)

## Why

Phase 6's native 7z/RAR readers will hand out **multiple concurrently-open member streams**
over a single underlying source. A source (an OS file handle or a `BinaryIO`) has exactly
**one file position**, so two open member streams that each `seek()`+`read()` the same handle
will clobber each other's offset and return interleaved/wrong bytes — **even in a single
thread**:

```python
s1 = ar.open("big1.bin")   # region [1000, …)
s2 = ar.open("big2.bin")   # region [5000, …)
s1.read(100)               # seek(1000), read
s2.read(100)               # seek(5000), read  → leaves the handle at 5100
s1.read(100)               # MUST seek back to 1100 first, or it reads big2's bytes
```

Today's seekable backends don't hit this: ZIP rides stdlib `zipfile`'s own `_SharedFile`,
ISO rides `pycdlib`, and single-file archives have one member. The native readers are the
**first** archivey-owned consumers that need it, so `PLAN.md` lands the plumbing **before**
Phase 6 as an entry gate. The `IDEAS.md` parallel-extraction note fixes the shape: a
`streamtools` shared-source view mirroring stdlib `zipfile._SharedFile` — one underlying
handle + a lock + a per-view position, each read seeking under the lock — plus a **decided
concurrency contract**: what is supported vs. what **fails loudly**, never silent
interleaving.

## What Changes

### The `streamtools` shared-source primitive (parallel-*ready*, single-reader *contract*)

Add a `SharedSource` factory to `streamtools` (which stays archivey-dependency-free):

- **`SharedSource.view(start, length) -> BinaryIO`** — mints an independent, seekable,
  **non-owning** view over `[start, start+length)` of the source. Each view carries its own
  `_pos`; every read does `seek(self._pos); data = read(n); self._pos += len(data)` under the
  source's lock, so the seek+read pair is **atomic** and interleaved views never corrupt each
  other. Views do not close the underlying source (the `SharedSource` owns it).
- **Lock included** — a `threading.Lock` guards seek+read, so the primitive is already
  thread-**correct** (concurrent readers are serialized at the I/O boundary, not garbled).
  This is cheap insurance; it does **not** by itself make the `ArchiveReader` thread-safe (the
  reader has other unguarded state — see the exploration change).
- **Parallel-ready seam, dormant for now** — for a **path** source, `SharedSource` *can* mint
  a *fresh independent handle* (`open(path, 'rb')`) per view for true parallel I/O; for a
  **stream** source (socket / `BytesIO` / pipe) it returns a locked shared view. For this
  change the seam is **dormant (default off)**: every view shares one handle + lock. Engaging
  live per-view handles belongs with the parallel-extraction feature. The seam exists as an
  API/flag now so engaging it later is not a retrofit.
- **Errors are stdlib-shaped** — the primitive raises `ValueError`/`OSError`/
  `io.UnsupportedOperation` (matching stdlib streams); it imports no `archivey.exceptions`
  (the `streamtools` independence rule). Translation to a typed `ArchiveyError` happens at the
  reader boundary, as with codec errors today. See `design.md` §A.

### The concurrency contract (decided; specced)

- **Supported (public, in `archive-reading`):** any number of concurrently-open member streams
  from **one reader**, read in interleaved order on one thread, all correct — for backends that
  serve members via independent byte-range views (see the delta carve-out).
- **Detectable primitive misuse → fail loudly:** read/seek after `close()`, or a view whose
  bounds fall outside the source, raises at the reader surface (translated from the primitive's
  stdlib-shaped error).
- **Unsupported / undefined (not "rejected loudly"):** driving the *reader object itself*
  from multiple threads (concurrent `open()` / iteration / `close()`). The reader holds no lock
  and does not detect this. `ArchiveReader` remains one-per-thread.
- **Implementation note only (not a public SHALL):** the shared-source lock also makes
  already-open member-stream reads data-correct across threads (serialized, not parallel). That
  is not promised in `packaging-and-extras`; see `design.md` §F–G.

### Retrofit current backends (validate the primitive before Phase 6)

Route archivey-owned seekable readers that map cleanly to a byte-range (or whole-source) view
through `SharedSource`, so the primitive is exercised by a real backend now, not only unit
tests (see `design.md` §D–E):

- **single-file** member open goes through `SharedSource.view(...)` (whole-source view + fresh
  codec per open); this also drops the `_first_stream` eager-stream scratch so open is
  reentrant (the invariant owned by the `parallel-reader-exploration` change).
- **ZIP** — **no wrap for either source kind** (revised at implementation review): stdlib
  `zipfile` coordinates a passed-in stream exactly as it does its own path handle (every
  member open goes through `_SharedFile`, per-open position, re-seek under `ZipFile._lock`),
  so an archivey wrap would duplicate that coordination. Concurrent-open tests are still
  required for both legs (design §C).
- **TAR-RA is carved out** (single shared `tarfile` / decompressor): exempt from the
  concurrent-open SHALL; may serve one member stream at a time.
- **ISO is out of scope, not non-compliant:** `pycdlib` owns member addressing the way
  `zipfile` owns `_SharedFile` for path sources — leave a design note, leave the code alone
  (`design.md` §D).
- Add a concurrent-open test (two members open and interleaved) for the ZIP retrofit and the
  primitive itself.

## Impact

- Affected specs: `archive-reading` (ADDED — concurrent-open member streams, with the
  solid/single-decoder carve-out for TAR-RA). **No** `packaging-and-extras` delta — the public
  install contract keeps its flat "not thread-safe (one per thread)"; the supported
  single-reader contract lives in `archive-reading` and the cross-thread data-correctness is
  an implementation note only (see `design.md` §G).
- Affected code: `src/archivey/internal/streams/streamtools/` (new `SharedSource`),
  `single_file_reader.py`, plus tests (ZIP needs no code change — stdlib `_SharedFile`
  coordinates both source kinds; design §C). TAR-RA and ISO
  untouched (TAR exempt; ISO pycdlib-owned).
- Risk: medium — touches working backends. Mitigated by the retrofit being a like-for-like
  swap of the slice/seek mechanism with the primitive plus added concurrent-open coverage; no
  behavior change for single-stream use.
- Relationship: this lands the **primitive + contract**. Making the *whole reader* parallel-safe
  (the `_open_member` reentrancy invariant + parallel extraction) is the separate
  `parallel-reader-exploration` change; this change deliberately keeps that seam open without
  promising it.
