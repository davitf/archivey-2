## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Read-only stream wrappers share one internal base

Read-only wrappers in this layer SHALL share an internal base for the read-only
`BinaryIO` surface (`readable`, `writable`, `write`) and canonical `readinto` /
`readall` built from each wrapper's `read`. The public codec-stream path SHALL
return an `ArchiveStream` carrying stream-level presentation metadata; internal
`backend.open()` calls MAY return raw backend streams.

The seekable decompressor path SHALL be a single concrete stream class
(`DecompressorStream`) parameterized by a `Decoder` strategy, not a per-codec
subclass hierarchy. Every codec — forward-only and segmented alike — SHALL plug in
through **one** decoder protocol, which also owns seek-index discovery:

```python
@dataclass
class DecodeOut:
    data: bytes
    points: list[SeekPoint]  # absolute; empty for forward-only codecs

class Decoder(Protocol):
    def recreate(self, point: SeekPoint, inner: BinaryIO) -> Decoder: ...
    def feed(self, chunk: bytes) -> DecodeOut: ...
    def flush(self) -> DecodeOut: ...
    @property
    def finished(self) -> bool: ...
    @property
    def pending_error(self) -> BaseException | None: ...
    # Default no-op; only index-bearing codecs (xz, lzip, future BGZF) override it.
    def build_index(
        self, inner: BinaryIO, last_known: SeekPoint
    ) -> tuple[list[SeekPoint], int | None]: ...
```

The stream — not the decoder — SHALL own the buffer, position, seek-point table,
and seek algorithm; it SHALL be format-agnostic, storing whatever `SeekPoint`s a
decoder emits. The `Decoder` SHALL choose seek-point placement (member/stream start
vs. post-realignment) and MAY perform progressive index enrichment during `feed`
using the `inner` it retained from `recreate`, restoring `inner`'s position itself.
Forward-only codecs SHALL emit empty `points`, keep `pending_error` `None`, and
inherit the no-op `build_index`. Deferred truncation (e.g. unix-compress leftover
bits) SHALL surface through `pending_error`, raised on the next empty `read` after
delivering bytes. Adding a codec SHALL add a `Decoder` and MUST NOT require a new
stream subclass or a `SegmentedDecompressorStream` layer.

#### Scenario: wrapper surface matrix

| Case | Expected |
| --- | --- |
| Any read-only stream wrapper is used | Shared base supplies read-only surface and `readinto` / `readall` |
| Public codec stream is opened | Returned object is an `ArchiveStream` with stream presentation metadata |

#### Scenario: decoder composition matrix

| Case | Expected |
| --- | --- |
| Forward-only codec (zlib, brotli, ppmd, bcj, deflate64) | Implements `recreate`/`feed`/`flush`/`finished`; emits empty `points`; `pending_error` `None`; inherits no-op `build_index` |
| Segmented boundary codec (lzip, xz stream start) | `feed` emits a `SeekPoint` at the boundary with the codec's own before/after placement; stream stores it |
| Progressive enrichment (xz block index) | `feed` scans the completed stream's footer via retained `inner` and emits block `SeekPoint`s (carrying resume `state`); restores `inner` position |
| One-shot / forward walk (xz, lzip backward scan; future BGZF forward walk) | `build_index` returns points + size; stream drives it demand-driven per `seekable-decompressor-streams` |
| Deferred truncation (unix-compress leftover bits) | `pending_error` set after `flush`; base raises it on the next empty `read` |
| A new codec is added | One `Decoder` added; no new stream subclass; no `SegmentedDecompressorStream` layer |
