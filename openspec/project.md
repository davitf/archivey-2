# Archivey — Project Context

> Authoritative contracts are the capability specs in this tree. Historical prose

## What this is

Archivey is a Python library for reading, streaming, and safely extracting
archives through a single, uniformly-typed interface. It presents ZIP, TAR (all
variants), RAR, 7z, ISO 9660, plain directories, and single-file compressed
streams (GZ/BZ2/XZ/ZST) as first-class, interchangeable objects.

## Design authority

When a format quirk cannot be cleanly mapped to the unified model, the library
surfaces the inconsistency as an explicit, documented field value (`None` or an
`Unknown` sentinel) — never as a silent guess, default, or exception.

## OpenSpec authoring

Default change schema is **`library`** (`openspec/config.yaml`): proposal →
compact specs + design → tasks. Use `--schema minimalist` for tiny deltas that
skip proposal/design.

- **Specs** keep OpenSpec’s structural headers (`### Requirement:` /
  `#### Scenario:`) so `openspec validate` works, but bodies stay dense:
  signatures + matrices, no user stories, one scenario per behavioral axis.
- **design.md** is where hard technical work lives (investigations, rejected
  alternatives, module layout). Full design for parsers/codecs/concurrency/
  safety; a short stub is enough for trivial deltas.

See `openspec/schemas/library/README.md` and the `rules:` / `context:` blocks in
`openspec/config.yaml`.

## Target environment

| Item | Constraint |
|------|------------|
| Python version | 3.11+ |
| Core dependencies | None (stdlib only) |
| Optional extras | `[7z]`, `[rar]`, `[crypto]`, `[7z-write]` (py7zr), `[iso]` (pycdlib), `[zstd]`, `[lz4]`, `[cli]`, `[seekable]`, `[recommended-lite]`, `[recommended]`, `[all]` — RAR data needs the system `unrar` binary (see `packaging-and-extras`) |
| OS support | Linux, macOS, Windows |
| Thread safety | The `ArchiveReader` object is not generally thread-safe. Declared `MemberStreams.CONCURRENT` coordinates first-touch materialization and draining `close()`, then unlocks concurrent `open()` / independent streams (see `reader-concurrency`); free-threaded correctness is covered by the Linux `3.13t` `free-threaded-concurrency` CI job. Writers are not thread-safe. |
| Concurrency model | Synchronous API only for v1 (async is a deferred follow-on). |

## Capability map

| Capability | Concern |
|------------|---------|
| `archive-reading` | `open_archive()`, the caller-facing `ArchiveReader` surface, iteration, random/sequential access, link following, passwords |
| `reader-concurrency` | `MemberStreams.CONCURRENT`, pass ownership, materialization coordination, draining close, free-threaded / backend lock invariants |
| `archive-writing` | `create()`, the `ArchiveWriter` surface, streaming conversion |
| `archive-data-model` | `Member`, `ArchiveInfo`, `ArchiveFormat`, `MemberType`, compression types |
| `access-mode-and-cost` | the `streaming: bool` access mode and the `CostReceipt` cost surface |
| `safe-extraction` | `extract()`, extraction policies, the non-bypassable filter contract, decompression-bomb limits, and extraction progress/result reporting |
| `format-detection` | `detect_format()`, magic table, non-seekable peek/replay |
| `backend-registry` | Backend registration, selection, the `Backend` ABC, optional deps |
| `error-handling` | The `ArchiveyError` hierarchy and error-translation contract |
| `diagnostics` | Lifecycle-aware advisory data: stable codes, exact bounded summaries, reader/stream/format/member/extraction aggregates, policy/callback delivery, and typed escalation |
| `logging` | The `archivey` logger hierarchy (cross-cutting; library never configures handlers) |
| `format-zip` / `format-tar` / `format-single-file-compressors` / `format-7z` / `format-rar` / `format-iso` / `format-directory` | Per-format behavioral contracts |
| `compressed-streams` | Uniform pull-based codec decompressor layer (single-file + 7z/ZIP container codecs + AES stage); format parsers compose it instead of calling codec libs |
| `seekable-decompressor-streams` | Random access inside single compressed streams (builds on `compressed-streams`) |
| `testing-contract` | Equivalence matrix, adversarial corpus, round-trip and non-seekable coverage |
| `cli` | The `archivey` command-line interface |
| `packaging-and-extras` | Install-time contract: zero-dep core (incl. native 7z read + RAR metadata), extras→capability mapping, Python/OS matrix, `__version__` |
| `documentation` | Source-derived API reference (MkDocs + mkdocstrings/Griffe extensions); strict docs build in CI |

**7z/RAR strategy (native-first):** 7z and RAR are read with **native** parsers,
not `py7zr`/`rarfile`. 7z reading decodes common codecs through stdlib
`lzma`/`bz2`/`zlib` (zero runtime deps); PPMd/Deflate64 come from the `[7z]` extra,
AES decryption from `[crypto]`, and only BCJ2 is detect-and-rejected. RAR metadata
is parsed natively (encrypted RAR5 headers decrypted via `[crypto]`) while the
external `unrar` binary does the proprietary data decompression. `py7zr` is kept
only for 7z *writing* (`[7z-write]`); `py7zr` and `rarfile` otherwise serve only as
`dev`-group test oracles (see `testing-contract`). Provenance: the `archivey-dev`
`sevenzip-native-reader` / `rar-native-metadata-reader` explorations (clone per
`CLAUDE.md`).

## Implementation order

The build sequence is a **clean-slate rewrite** — new code written fresh against
the specs, with `archivey-dev` as reference-only (leaf format/codec logic is
ported as isolated units; the spine is written fresh). See `PLAN.md` (repo root)
for the detailed, phase-by-phase task list, the layered port-vs-rewrite split,
the frozen-oracle test strategy, and the per-phase acceptance criteria (each
phase's "done" is defined as a set of covered spec scenarios). Phases are
feature/layer milestones, so a phase typically advances several capabilities at
once. Specs themselves remain order-free; this table is the association.

| Phase | Theme | Primary capabilities advanced |
|-------|-------|-------------------------------|
| 1 | Scaffold + spine + new test harness + directory backend | `packaging-and-extras` (pyproject, extras, env matrix, `__version__`); `backend-registry`, `archive-data-model`, `error-handling`, `access-mode-and-cost` (types/contracts written fresh); `format-directory` (the spine's first backend — no codec/detection layer needed); `logging`; `testing-contract` (framework foundations: declarative corpus, on-demand generation + cache, no committed binaries). DEV cloned as a frozen oracle. |
| 2 | Stream layer (compressed + seekable) | `compressed-streams`, `seekable-decompressor-streams`. (7z/ZIP container codecs `pyppmd`/`inflate64`/AES stage land with Phase 6.) |
| 3 | Indexed leaf formats | `format-zip`, `format-tar` (random-access **read** + compressed-tar), `format-single-file-compressors`, `format-iso`, `format-detection`, `backend-registry` (selection/degradation + tri-state availability), `access-mode-and-cost` (CostReceipt values). (`format-directory` already landed in Phase 1.) |
| 4 | TAR streaming & safe extraction | `format-tar` (forward-only `stream_members`), `safe-extraction` (incl. bomb limits + progress/result), `archive-reading` (sequential + `stream_members`) |
| 5 | Public API finalization, cost surface & diagnostics | `archive-reading`, `reader-concurrency`, `archive-data-model`, `access-mode-and-cost`, `error-handling`; then the `diagnostics-warnings-as-data` follow-on advances `diagnostics`, `logging`, `format-detection`, `safe-extraction`, `compressed-streams`, `seekable-decompressor-streams`, `format-directory`, `format-tar`, and `format-zip` before Phase 6 |
| 6 | Native 7z reader + native RAR metadata parser (resequenced 2026-07 ahead of writing — see `VISION.md`; fuzzing is an entry gate) | `format-7z`, `format-rar` (native-first: read path imports no third-party lib; `unrar` binary stays for RAR data; `py7zr` for 7z write only); `testing-contract` oracle cross-validation |
| 7 | CLI (pulled forward: dev tool + safe-extraction demo) | `cli` |
| 8 | Seekable zstd + blocked gzip (rescoped — the original zst/lz4 *read* goals landed with Phases 2–3; `w:zst` writing moved to the writing phase) | `seekable-decompressor-streams`, `format-single-file-compressors` |
| 9 | Writing support (not a 1.0 requirement; spec to cover reproducible output + metadata fidelity first) | `archive-writing` (+ `format-zip` / `format-tar` writers) |
| 10 | Polish, packaging & oracle retirement | `cli`, `packaging-and-extras` (finalize), full `testing-contract` (corpus complete, frozen DEV oracle deleted) (+ cross-cutting: README, final CI tuning — the matrix is stood up in Phase 1; coverage is reported, **not** gated) |

`logging` is cross-cutting and not owned by a single phase — the named-logger
hierarchy is established in Phase 1 and used by every phase thereafter. Structured
`diagnostics` is sequenced as a Phase 5 public-API follow-on, before the Phase 6 native
readers add further advisory paths; logging becomes a policy-controlled projection of
those values. The new test suite is built incrementally from Phase 1 and becomes the sole
suite in Phase 10, when the frozen DEV oracle is deleted.

> They have been folded into `safe-extraction` (both are extraction-time
> guarantees, now scheduled under Phase 4); the cross-cutting logging concern was

## Deferred / out of scope (v1)

These are **decided** deferrals (a conscious "not for v1"):

- In-place archive modification (append/update).
- Encryption write for 7z/RAR.
- Native sparse-file extraction (detected and flagged, extracted dense).
- NTFS junction recreation on non-Windows.
- Async API.

Multi-volume **joining** is **no longer deferred**: `format-rar` and `format-7z` now
specify reading a split set as one logical archive (RAR volume stitching; 7z volume
concatenation). See those specs.

For looser, **speculative** "might do later" ideas (native streaming ZIP, libarchive
backend, pathlib/fsspec navigation, subprocess decompressors, …) see `IDEAS.md` at the
repo root.
