"""Guard: every package pinned in a user-facing extra is used by ``src/``.

The packaging contract (``packaging-and-extras``) is that an optional **extra** lists only
libraries some ``src/`` code path actually imports for that capability — never a dead or
test-only dependency. This test enforces it mechanically so a stray pin can't slip back in
(as ``python-xz`` and ``pyzstd`` once had — see ``docs/library-analysis.md``).

It parses ``[project.optional-dependencies]`` from ``pyproject.toml``, expands the bundle
extras (``archivey[...]`` self-references) down to leaf third-party packages, and asserts each
is referenced by some ``src/`` file — with a small, documented allowlist for capabilities whose
implementation is a later phase.
