"""Canary for the accelerator interpreter-shutdown abort and archivey's guard against it
(see ``docs/known-issues.md`` and ``_AcceleratorStream`` in ``archivey.internal.streams.codecs``).

archivey uses a single accelerator library, ``rapidgzip``, for both gzip (``RapidgzipFile``) and
bzip2 (its bundled ``IndexedBzip2File``) — deliberately NOT the separate ``indexed_bzip2``
package, because loading both into one process corrupts the heap and aborts on macOS (see
``test_archivey_uses_single_accelerator_library`` below and ``docs/known-issues.md``).

The accelerator spawns C++ worker threads. A thread still running when the interpreter finalizes
trips the library's guard ("Detected Python finalization from running … thread") and aborts the
process with SIGABRT. Critically, ``join_threads()`` does **not** stop the thread — only
``close()`` does — so a stream must be *closed*, not merely joined, before it is freed.

The matrix below crosses both codecs (each via rapidgzip) × intact / corrupt / truncated input ×
cleanup strategy, each in its own subprocess (so any abort is contained), and is emitted as a
warning for the record:

- ``closed`` — ``read()`` then ``join_threads()`` + ``close()`` during the run.
- ``cycle_gc`` / ``unclosed`` — the **raw** object finalized by the cyclic GC mid-run, or left to
  interpreter shutdown, with **no** close. These abort on every platform measured — the
  underlying-library behaviour archivey works around.
- ``guard_cycle_gc`` / ``guard_unclosed`` — the same two finalization paths but wrapped in a
  faithful copy of archivey's ``weakref.finalize`` guard, which **closes** the raw object when
  the wrapper is reclaimed. These exit cleanly, which is why the accelerator is safe to use.

Asserted invariants: ``closed`` and the two ``guard_*`` paths exit cleanly on every platform (the
cleanup contract archivey depends on), while the raw ``cycle_gc`` / ``unclosed`` paths abort (the
upstream behaviour; if a future release stops aborting there, the assertion flips, signalling the
close-on-finalize guard is no longer load-bearing).
